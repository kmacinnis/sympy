def kahane_simplify(expression):
    r"""
    This function cancels contracted elements in an expression of four
    dimensional gamma matrices, resulting in an expression equal to the given
    one, without the contracted gamma matrices.

    Algorithm
    =========

    The idea behind the algorithm is to use some well-known identities,
    i.e., for contractions enclosing an even number of `\gamma` matrices

    `\gamma^\mu \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N}} \gamma_\mu = 2 (\gamma_{a_{2N}} \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N-1}} + \gamma_{a_{2N-1}} \cdots \gamma_{a_1} \gamma_{a_{2N}} )`

    for an odd number of `\gamma` matrices

    `\gamma^\mu \gamma_{a_1} \cdots \gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \gamma_\mu = -2 \gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \gamma_{a_{2N}} \cdots \gamma_{a_{1}}`

    Instead of repeatedly applying these identities to cancel out all contracted indices,
    it is possible to recognize the links that would result from such an operation,
    the problem is thus reduced to a simple rearrangement of free gamma matrices.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import Lorentz, GammaMatrix4D as G, kahane_simplify
    >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import tensor_indices, tensorhead
    >>> i0, i1, i2 = tensor_indices('i0:3', Lorentz)
    >>> kahane_simplify(G(i0)*G(-i0))
    4
    >>> kahane_simplify(G(i0)*G(i1)*G(-i0))
    -2*G(i1)

    If there are no contractions, the same expression is returned

    >>> kahane_simplify(3*G(i0)*G(i1))
    3*G(i0)*G(i1)
